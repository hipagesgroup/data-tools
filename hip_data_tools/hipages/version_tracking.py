"""
This module helps us version track classes by capturing the
latest git hash of the file they are written in, and dumping these versions to
a json file

The application looks through a package for classes with the registration
decorator. The last git commit has for files which contain this decorator are
then used to track the current version of the class

Example:
  The application takes two arguments the name of the package you're interested
  in, and the output location for the json file

  $ python version-tracker -p transformers -o ./version.json

It also provides transparent functions which can be used as decorators to
classes, functions and methods to tag them as requiring tracking by the
version control app

Typical usage:

from version_tracking import register_class_for_version_tracking
from version_tracking import register_method_for_version_tracking

@register_class_for_version_tracking
class Foo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.foo = 'some value'


    @register_method_for_version_tracking
    def track_this_method(self):
        return self.foo

When the version tracking app is executed the latest githash of the files
containing registered classes, functions, and methods will be logged to disk
in a json file
